          Hi, my name is Dakota Adams and I love to tinker with computers and
          various technologies. I currently have over 6 years of experience as a
          Diesel Technician and I am trying to achieve my life long goal of
          working in the tech industry. Lately I have been learning vast amount
          of python, html, css, and javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          My true passions in life are; spending time with family, music, and traveling.
          I feel each of these things are a necessary core ideal. Family keeps me grounded,
          music helps with my creativity and traveling broadens the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that I am quite fond of is great stories. Anything that has world building
          beyond surface level. I love spending time diving deep into these creations.
          Almost to a fault. I can tell you just about anything about Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another key thing about me is I love to learn new things. Life is too short
          to not do all you can and learn as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someday I hope to find a way to take all of my passions and hobbies, and combine them all
          into a massive project. Perhaps for educational purposes or in an application form that integrates
          music learning with some of my favorite IPs.
        </p>
        <p>
